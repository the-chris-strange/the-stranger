# TheStranger

[![codecov][coverage-badge]][coverage]

A collection of (opinionated) plugins & reusable configurations for TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier, Vite, NX, Yarn, and more.

## Why TheStranger?

TheStranger is a reference to the book "L'Ã‰tranger" by Albert Camus, which explores themes of absurdism and existentialism. It has absolutely nothing to do with this repository or its contents; it's just a good book. Also, @the-stranger lends itself well to the npm registry's naming requirements, whereas @lestranger works less well. So, here we are.
